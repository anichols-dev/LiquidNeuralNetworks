# An Exploration of Liquid Neural Networks

For our Artificial Neural Networks course at DIS Copenhagen, we sought out to build our own Liquid Neural Network (LNN) from scratch and compare it with well-tested, well-documented model architectures. Our ultimate goal was to explore the LNN architecture, with the subgoal to build a model that outperformed some industry standard, optimized structures.
